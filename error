CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:41 (target_link_libraries):
  The keyword signature for target_link_libraries has already been used with
  the target "server".  All uses of target_link_libraries with a target must
  be either all-keyword or all-plain.

  The uses of the keyword signature are here:

   * CMakeLists.txt:38 (target_link_libraries)


CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:48 (target_link_libraries):
  Target "server" links to:

    absl::log_internal_check_op

  but the target was not found.  Possible reasons include:

    * There is a typo in the target name.
    * A find_package call is missing for an IMPORTED target.
    * An ALIAS target is missing.
